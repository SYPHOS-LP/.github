# SYPHOS

**Intelligence at the Edge**

SYPHOS is a Greek technology startup specializing in AI on the edge with applications across space systems, autonomous platforms and mission-critical environments.

## What We Do

We develop intelligent systems that process data where it's generated: on satellites, autonomous vehicles and embedded platforms. 

Our expertise spans:

- **Edge AI**: Cross-domain artificial intelligence for resource-constrained environments
- **Space Systems**: On-board data processing and satellite applications
- **AI Engineering**: Custom machine learning solutions and data science
- **Hardware Acceleration**: FPGA and GPU implementations

## Technology Focus

- On-board data processing and autonomous decision-making
- Hardware-accelerated inference (FPGA, embedded GPU)
- Real-time AI for space and terrestrial applications
- Optimization for power, latency and compute constraints

## Selected Projects

### Spectrum Sharing Governor (2024-2025)
Dynamic frequency allocation system for satellite-ground station communications, developed for LibreSpace Foundation's Makerspace initiative (ESA-funded).
- **Repository**: [GitLab - LibreSpace Foundation](https://gitlab.com/librespacefoundation/spectrum-sharing-makerspace/spectrum-sharing-governor/-/tree/STAGE-01)
